        <h3>What is the meaning of life?</h3>
        <h3>How do we live meaningful lives?</h3>
        <h3>How do the relationships we partake in, the moral we believe, and the cultural norms we adopt, help us construct and maintain a sense of meaning?</h3>
        <p>I'm a first year master's student in psychology at the University of British Columbia. I work with Dr. Steven Heine, and my research explores the intersections between culture, morality, meaning, and relationships.</p>
        <p>On this website, I feature my academic work and profile. I also blog regularly on a number of topics spanning personal thoughts to critical explorations of the path to becoming a research psychologist.</p>
