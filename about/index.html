            I'm a first year master's student in psychology at the University of British Columbia. I work with Dr. Steve Heine in the Culture and Self lab, and my research explores the intersections between culture, morality, meaning, and relationships.

            The focus of my research interests is the psychology of fundamental human motives and the ways in which these motives manifest and are pursued in daily life. I am particularly interested in investigating cultural meaning systems, moral meaning systems, and the role of interpersonal relationships in providing and disrupting meaning.

            On this website, I feature my academic work and profile. I also blog regularly on a number of topics spanning personal thoughts to critical explorations of the path to becoming a research psychologist.
